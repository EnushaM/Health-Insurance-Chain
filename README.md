Built an Insurance Premium predictor to predict the premium Insurance amount and to detect Fraud Claims Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning. Implemented deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to train the model with Resnet and used many ML classifiers to bring out an accuracy of more than 90%. The model is implemented as a Web-based application with Streamlit, Python, and Keras. It can be used in Banking Sectors to effectively determine the insurance to be provided and to detect fraud claims.
