**Module 1** Fraud Claim Predictor to predict whether the person claiming insurance is genuine or fraudulent.
**Module 2** Insurance Premium Predictor, And if found genuine the tool will direct the banking official to another page for predicting the optimum claimable insurance premium amount by the person.
**Module 3** Repayment Date Predictor, forecast a payerâ€™s response date and the possible delay period to a claim even before the claim has been submitted.
Implemented deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to train the model with Resnet and used many Machine Learning (ML) regression models to bring out an accuracy of more than 90% in Insurance Premium Prediction and an increased performance in the ML model for Repayment Date Prediction.
